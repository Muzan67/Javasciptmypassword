## JavaScript: Password Generator

I created an application that generates a random password based on the criteria that the user selects.
The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
The Password Generator App has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The Password Generator creates multiple possibilities of characters and unique specififcations to the users criteria.
