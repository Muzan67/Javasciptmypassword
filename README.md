# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator - Description

I created an application that generates a random password based on the criteria that the user selects. 
The Password Generator creates cn range from many characters and multiple posibilities. 

# Instalation

I created a Variable for each function, and stored the data for each Variable that was declared so the password generator could return the final password.

I created prompts for the user to create their unique passwords to their liking and specifics. 

I used the If statement for if the condition was true to push to the password generator to create the password.
